# MojoMatch question type plugin for Moodle

## Description
This is a question type plugin that provides additional matching options for a short answer question. The new question type is an extension of the SHORTANSWER question type. It also will communicate with TopoMojo to pull answers from a running gamespace. It is used in conjunction with the Moodle activity plugin for TopoMojo labs, mod_topomojo and also the MojoMatch question behaviour plugin for Moodle, qbehaviour_mojomatch..

## Matching Options
### Match
This is the same as the short answer question.
### MatchAlpha
This strips all non-alphanumeric characters from both the answer and response before comparison.
### MatchAny
This checks for the response to contain the answer as a substring.
### MatchAll
This checks for the response to be a list of terms that is compared against the answer as a list of terms.
